## Critical research on the topic
### Paper 1:
[Crop yield prediction using ML-Algo](./crop-yield-prediction-using-machine-learning-algorithms-IJERTCONV9IS13019.pdf)

    Anakha, Aparna, Jinsu, Rima [1], has applied machine learning algorithms on the dataset comprised of data from different offical government websites. It had features like crop name, area, production, temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind speeds. The accuracy of the models that they used, are Logistic regression with 87.8%, Naive Bayes with 91.50% and Random Forest with 92.81%. Their goal was to predict the yield and the names of crop from the regions of Kerala. They compared their models and then selected Random Forest as their target model. They also proposed a mobile application which predicts the name of the crop as well as calculate it's corresponding yield. 

### Paper 2:
[Crop Yield Prediction Using Random Forest Algorithm](./7-crop-yield-prediction-using-random-forest-algorithm-for-major-cities-in-maharashtra-state.pdf)

    Kiran, Suyog, Smit used random forest to predict crop yield. Their target was to get the maximum yield of crops. They say they analysed and compared of all classification methods and then choose Random Forest Classification technique. In thier model, they have used 10-fold cross-validation technique which is indicates which is gives high accuracy and correlation between the climate and the crop yield and accuracy of the model is found 87%. They collected data from various cities of Maharastra state, crop data, climate, region was essential for their research so they gathered data from goverment sources. Their goal was also to build a web app that will predict the crop yield based on the factors of climate change. 

### Paper 3:
[An artificial intelligence based approach for increasing agricultural yield](./807c6cb607284780d9975bfa003a73a787ce.pdf)

    Ankur, Avinash, Ashwani, Chandan worked on to identify a suitable crop, based on soil and the climate, along with the plan disease detection. They applied an aritifical intelligence based techniques to predict a suitable crop and also detect the disease in plant leafs at an early stage. They used Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the dataset. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with ResNet152 architecture is used for the detection of plant disease. Their dataset consisted of 54,306 photos of healthy and diseased crops. They found crop predictions based on LR and SVM have achieved an accuracy of 93% and 97% respectively across a class of 13  crops. CNN based model predicted disease among 38 different categories from 14 specific crops with an accuracy of 96%. Their goal was to propose an  approach that will be beneficial to farmers to identify suitable crops and have plant leaf disease under control.

### Paper 4:
[Crop Yield Prediction Using Linear Support Vector Machine](./EJMCM_Volume%207_Issue%206_Pages%202189-2195.pdf)

    N.Manjunathan, P.Rajesh, E. Thangadurai, A. Suresh proposed to build a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict the rice crop yield prediction. SVM is used to classify whether rice can grow in that area based on the data from soil, temperature, underground water and rainfall. SVM was also used to classify the crop based on the factors of the area, season. And they also implemented a Web Application that enabled their users to interact with the ML model and make their prediction with their given inputs. The dataset is comprised of data collected from Goverment websites. Their research shows that the average temperature, nitrogen in soil and season had the most effect on rice production. Their Machine Learning model which was trained with Support Vector Machine has managed to obtain an accuracy percentage of 96.5%. 


### Paper 5:
[Rice Yield Forecasting Using Support Vector Machine](./D7236118419.pdf)

    Sunil Kumar, Vivek Kumar, R. K. Sharma have used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to forcast the rice yield. They have experimented on conducting one-against-one multi classification method, k-fold cross validation and polynomial kernel function for SVM training. The dataset has been sourced from Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. They also have implemented neural networks that have significant application in the behaviour forcasting, they mentioned the pros and cons of using such method. Their best prediction accuracy for the 4- year relative average increase has been recorded at 75.06% using 4-fold cross validation method. Though this was not very high accuracy, they believe that they could have improved it by redefining the training patterns.

### Paper 6:
[Improving Crop Productivity Through A Crop Recommendation System Using Ensembling Technique ](./28189-Article%20Text-43701-1-10-20200706.pdf)

    The authors hypothesized analysis of explotative data and thought of designing different types of predictive models. They have used ensemble framework, which works by imcorporating multile models and it provides a classifier that outperforms each individual classifiers. They imcorporated Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Linear SVM as the independent base learners used to create the ensemble model.  Using this article, we obtain a comparative study of the different algorithms in data analytics. This helped in  determining which algorithm is most appropriate to the proposed system.
